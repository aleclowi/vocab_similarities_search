If this great law of Newtons found such general application beyond our
planet it served an equally useful purpose in explaining a number of
puzzling features on this planet The ebb and flow of the tides was one
of these puzzles Even in ancient times it had been noticed that a full
moon and a high tide went hand in hand and various mysterious powers
were attributed to the satellite and the ocean Newton pointed out that
the height of the water was a direct consequence of the attractive
power of the moon and to a lesser extent because further away
of the sun

One of his first explanations however dealt with certain
irregularities in the moons motion around the earth If the solar
system would consist of the earth and moon alone then the path of the
moon would be that of an ellipse with one of the foci of this ellipse
occupied by the earth Unfortunately for the simplicity of the problem
there are other bodies relatively near in space particularly that huge
body the sun The sun not only exerts its pull on the earth but also
on the moon However as the sun is much further away from the moon
than is the earth the earths attraction for its satellite is much
greater despite the fact that the sun is much huger and weighs far
more than the earth The greater pull of the earth in one direction
and a lesser pull of the sun in

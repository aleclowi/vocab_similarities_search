RoseRed went and pushed back the bolt thinking that it was a poor
man but it was not It was a Bear that stretched his broad black head
within the door

RoseRed screamed and sprang back the lamb bleated the dove
fluttered and SnowWhite hid herself behind her mothers bed

But the Bear began to speak and said Do not be afraid I will do you
no harm I am halffrozen and only want to warm myself a little beside
you

Poor Bear said the mother lie down by the fire Only take care
that you do not burn your coat Then she cried SnowWhite RoseRed
come out the Bear will do you no harm he means well

So they both came out and byandby the lamb and dove came nearer and
were not afraid of him

The Bear said Here Children knock the snow out of my coat a
little so they brought the broom and swept the Bears hide clean
And he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and
comfortably

It was not long before they grew quite at home and played tricks with
their clumsy guest They tugged at his hair with their hands put their
feet upon his back and rolled him about or they took a hazelswitch
and beat him and when he growled they laughed But the Bear took it
all in good part only when they were too rough he called out Leave
me alive Children

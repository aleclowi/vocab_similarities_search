Up to the present however we have by no means maintained the equivalence of all bodies of reference K in connection with the formulation of natural laws Our course was more on the following lines In the first place we started out from the assumption that there exists a referencebody K whose condition of motion is such that the Galileian law holds with respect to it A particle left to itself and sufficiently far removed from all other particles moves uniformly in a straight line With reference to K Galileian referencebody the laws of nature were to be as simple as possible But in addition to K all bodies of reference K should be given preference in this sense and they should be exactly equivalent to K for the formulation of natural laws provided that they are in a state of uniform rectilinear and nonrotary motion with respect to K all these bodies of reference are to be regarded as Galileian referencebodies The validity of the principle of relativity was assumed only for these referencebodies but not for others eg those possessing motion of a different kind In this sense we speak of the special principle of relativity or special theory of relativity

In contrast to this we wish to understand by the general principle of relativity the following statement All bodies of reference K K etc are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena formulation of the general laws of nature whatever may be their state of motion But

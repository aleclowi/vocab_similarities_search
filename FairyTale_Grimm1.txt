The wife of a rich man fell sick and as she felt that her end was
drawing near she called her only daughter to her bedside and said
Dear Child be good and pious and then the dear God will always
protect you and I will look down on you from Heaven and be near you
Thereupon she closed her eyes and departed

Every day the maiden went out to her mothers grave and wept and she
remained pious and good When winter came the snow spread a white sheet
over the grave and when the springsun had drawn it off again the man
had taken another wife

The woman had brought two daughters into the house with her who were
beautiful and fair of face but vile and black of heart Now began a
bad time for the poor child Is the stupid goose to sit in the parlor
with us said they He who wants to eat bread must earn it Out with
the kitchenwench

They took her pretty clothes away from her put an old gray bedgown
on her and gave her wooden shoes Just look at the proud Princess
how decked out she is they cried and laughed and led her into the
kitchen

There she had to do hard work from morning till night get up before
daybreak carry water light fires cook and wash Besides this the
sisters did her every imaginable injurythey mocked her and emptied
her peas and lentils into the ashes
